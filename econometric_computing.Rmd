title: "Econometric Computing"

Econometrics is an important part of any economists toolbox and you should expect to learn a fair bit of econometrics in your programme. While you will no doubt learn about important conceptual issues (Can I use the data to establish a causal relationship?), theoretical properties (Is this estimator unbiased?) you will also have to learn to get your hands dirty. 

This will imply statistical programming of sorts. The Economics Department of the University of Manchester has written a specific resource to support students with this skill, [Econometric Computing Learning Resource (ECLR)](http://eclr.humanities.manchester.ac.uk/index.php/Main_Page). This resource covers three computing languages (**EVIEWS**, **MATLAB** and **R**).

Another popular statistical language in Economics is **STATA** and the [Stata Corporation](https://www.stata.com/links/resources-for-learning-stata/) provides a list of useful STATA tutorials.
