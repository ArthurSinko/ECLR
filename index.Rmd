This is a sisterpage of this [Wiki](http://eclr.humanities.manchester.ac.uk/index.php/Main_Page) which describes how to implement basic econometric techniques in R and Matlab.

On this webpage we collate empirical examples which can be used to help students understand a range of statistical and econometric techniques. This page benefits from a range of empirical examples which have been implemented in a range of books.

- [The Art of Statistics](https://dspiegel29.github.io/ArtofStatistics/) by David Speigelhalter
- [Mastering Metrics](https://www.masteringmetrics.com/) by Joshua Angrist and J&ouml;rn-Steffen Pischke
- [Mostly Harmless Econometrics](https://economics.mit.edu/faculty/angrist/data1/mhe) by Joshua Angrist and J&ouml;rn-Steffen Pischke

The examples from these books and others have been amended or re-written such that students can either use them directly or to facilitate adoption by leacturers.
