## On referencing

This [online resource](https://www.escholar.manchester.ac.uk/learning-objects/mle/introducing-referencing/story_html5.html) explores the principles behind referencing, highlighting why it is good academic practice. It outlines when and how you need to reference, and how to read a reference when following up a source listed on a reading list or bibliography. (UoM, Learning Essentials)

Here we use the Harvard referencing style and all your referencing should adhere to this [guidance](http://subjects.library.manchester.ac.uk/referencing/referencing-harvard). (UoM)
