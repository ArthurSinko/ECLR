As an economist you will deal with real-life data. We use these data to understand crucial relationships in the econmy, to discover stylised facts and to uncover causal relationships. In particular the latter is a conceptually really difficult endeavour and you will have to attend econometrics course units to understand how we use data to establish the existence of such relationships.

## Data Sources

We live in times of Big Data. As many transactions in the economy occur via automised services which record these transactions, many organisations (think Google, Facebook, VISA, etc.) are generating truly gigantic datasets. Most of these data are private and not publically available.

However, a very large number of data are available publicably. These are often generated by National statistics agencies, or by government sponsored academic institutions which organise large surveys. Below is a list of places useful data sources for economists.

* [FRED](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/){target="_blank"}, Mainly US but also international time series  
* [Office of National Statistics](https://www.ons.gov.uk/){target="_blank"}, The UK Statistics agency  
* [Eurostat](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat){target="_blank"}, the statistics agency of the European Union  
* [OECD](https://data.oecd.org/){target="_blank"}, an organisation of developped countries with a significant data store  
* [Consumer Data Research Center](https://data.cdrc.ac.uk/){target="_blank"}, UK data on Election Data, Residence-Workplace and travel mode data from Census, Council Tax Maps, Index of Multiple Deprivation, Population density  
*	[The UK Data Service](https://www.ukdataservice.ac.uk/){target="_blank"}, UK Census data, International macrodata, Longitudinal studies,	Qualitative/mixed methods and UK surveys  
* [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/){target="_blank"}, Data Stories with good links to the original data sources  

You could also browse a range of websites which link to a variety of datasets:

## Econometrics

Econometrics is an important part of any economists toolbox and you should expect to learn a fair bit of econometrics in your programme. While you will no doubt learn about important conceptual issues (Can I use the data to establish a causal relationship?), theoretical properties (Is this estimator unbiased?) you will also have to learn to get your hands dirty. 

This will imply statistical programming of sorts. The Economics Department of the University of Manchester has written a specific resource to support students with this skill, [Econometric Computing Learning Resource (ECLR)](http://eclr.humanities.manchester.ac.uk/index.php/Main_Page). This resource covers three computing languages (**EVIEWS**, **MATLAB** and **R**).

Another popular statistical language in Economics is **STATA** and the [Stata Corporation](https://www.stata.com/links/resources-for-learning-stata/) provides a list of useful STATA tutorials.
