## Support for students with English as a second language

If you come to The University of Manchester, you have accepted that English is your language of study. For a large proportion of students English is, however, not their first language. If you are one of these students then this will pose an additional challenge. [The University of Manchester Language Centre](https://www.languagecentre.manchester.ac.uk/resources/support-and-advice/) offers support which is specifically designed for overseas students. 

In pparticular you should seek out the [super helpful tips](https://www.languagecentre.manchester.ac.uk/resources/support-and-advice/helpsheets-and-worksheets/) on **listening**, **reading**, **speaking** and **writing** in English. It is important to recognise that these skills cannot be taught, but you will have to invest time into applying these skills and the above links offers useful suggestions of what you can do to practice these.

The University of Manchester's Library has also produced the award winning [My Learning Essentials skills programme](https://www.library.manchester.ac.uk/using-the-library/students/training-and-skills-support/my-learning-essentials/). It consists of a combination of short online and in-person workshops which you can access to improve your academic skills. These are designed for all students, not only international students.
